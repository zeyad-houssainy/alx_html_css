# My Custom Web Page Project

## Project Overview

In this project, your goal is to build a fully functional and visually accurate web page from scratch, using only your foundational knowledge of HTML and CSS. You will **not** be using any external libraries, frameworks, or pre-processors (e.g., Bootstrap, React, Sass, etc.). This is a pure vanilla HTML/CSS challenge!

The primary objective is to replicate a given design file as closely as possible, ensuring the web page is:

* **Semantic HTML:** Structured logically and meaningfully using appropriate HTML5 elements.
* **Styled with CSS:** Visually appealing and faithful to the design using only plain CSS.
* **Accessible:** Built with accessibility best practices in mind, ensuring it's usable by everyone.
* **Responsive:** Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, mobile) using responsive design techniques.

## Key Requirements

* **No External Libraries/Frameworks:** All styling and structure must be implemented using raw HTML and CSS.
* **Pixel-Perfect Design (or as close as possible):** The final web page should visually match the provided designer file. Pay close attention to spacing, fonts, colors, element sizing, and layout.
* **Accessibility First:** Implement ARIA attributes, proper semantic tags, keyboard navigation, and other accessibility considerations to ensure a robust user experience for all.
* **Responsive Design:** Utilize media queries and flexible layouts (Flexbox, Grid) to make the page look great on various devices.
* **Clean and Organized Code:** Write well-structured, readable, and maintainable HTML and CSS.
* **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Test your page across different modern browsers to ensure consistent rendering.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-name>
    ```
2.  **Review the Designer File:** Ensure you have access to the design file (e.g., Figma, Sketch, PSD, JPG) that you need to replicate. This README assumes you already have this.
3.  **Create your `index.html` and `style.css` files:** Start building your page incrementally.
    ```bash
    touch index.html
    touch style.css
    ```
4.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:** As you develop, continuously check your progress.
